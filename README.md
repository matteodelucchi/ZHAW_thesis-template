# ZHAW thesis template

This is a template for LaTeX thesis (M.Sc. or PhD) at [Zurich University of Applied Sciences, ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/).
This repository was created to relieve future students of the tedious work of thesis formatting. 
Make sure that it meets your programme specific requirements and the details that need to be discussed with the supervisor. 

## Usage

I found it very convenient to use this template in [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/). This allowed me to share it with my supervisor, who could comment directly in the document.  
Fork this Github repository to your Github account. Then you login to [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/) -> *New Project* -> *Import from Github* and select your fork of the thesis template.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this project to improve it.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork this repo if you didn't already.
2. Clone in to the dev branch.
3. Commit changes on the dev branch.
4. Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to merge in the [master branch of the original repository](https://github.com/matteodelucchi/ZHAW_thesis-template/tree/master)

## Versions

For major (i.e. study program specific) changes, I suggest to have multiple branches which are going to be explained here. 
The current master branch was used for a Master thesis of the [Applied Computational Life Sciences Master program](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/lsfm/institutes-centres/ias/study-teaching/master/) at the [Institute of Applied Simulations](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/lsfm/institutes-centres/ias-institute-of-applied-simulation/) from the department [Life Science and Facility Management](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/lsfm/).
